# django_rss_feed_parser
A RSS Feed Parser built using Django to read the RSS feeds for NPR, Ars Technica, and a local news station. Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. Link to the project http://18.117.33.76/mysite/ . I haven't connected the site to a website domain nor have I setup TLS certificates so the site will probably say "not secure" on some browsers (the site uses http rather than https.)
